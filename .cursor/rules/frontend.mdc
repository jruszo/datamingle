# Frontend Application

The `src` directory houses the Next.js frontend application.

-   **Framework**: Next.js
-   **Architecture**: Client-first. Minimize server-side rendering (SSR) and the use of server actions.
-   **Server Processing**: All server-related processing should be handled by the backend API located in the `backend` directory.
